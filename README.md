# Demand Forecasting for a Retail Store
This project uses time-series sales data from a retail store to build a demand forecasting model. By analyzing historical sales patterns, the model predicts future sales, enabling better inventory management and decision-making. Techniques such as Linear Regression and ARIMA are applied to forecast demand trends.
